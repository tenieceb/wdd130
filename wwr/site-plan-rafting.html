        <h2>Style Guide</h2>

        <h3>Color Palette</h3>
        <!--Color Palette: Using the coolors.co tool, choose a color scheme for your rafting site, keeping your site purpose and audience in mind. 
        Start by thinking of a color you like or think will work well for a rafting site.
        Once you have built your palette, note that at the bottom of each color column there is a six digit hex code. 
        This is what is known as a hexadecimal color code (base 16 or 0 to F) and is usually preceded by a "#". 
        Copy that code for the 3‚Äì4 colors you would like to use into the site plan document.
        List the colors you have selected in the site plan paragraph using a structure of your choice below the color palette heading. 
        Include the 'name' of the color (given below) and the hexadecimal color code. These are the four (4) labeled 'names' that we will use in
        the CSS.
        primary-color
        secondary-color
        accent1-color
        accent2-color-->
        <p></p>
        <h3>Typography</h3>
        <!--Typography:
        Using the Google Fonts API, choose one or two fonts to use for the rafting site and record the names of the fonts and the category of font
         (serif, sans-serif, display, handwriting, or monospace) in the site plan under the appropriate heading provide for headings, paragraphs, and the callout box.-->
