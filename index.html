            <p>Hello, my name is Teniece Busenbark. I live in Eastern Utah, with my husband, our 3 kids, 2 cats, and 1 dog.
                 We have been married for 13 years. Our kids are 9 years old, 7 years old, and 4 years old and they are homeschooled. 
                 I work part time at UPS in the mornings and my husband works from home. I am learning new skills so that I may also work
                  from home and supplement income. I run a little side business of crocheting amigurumi to sell. One of my favorite projects I
                  have done is a gigantic dinosaur. 
            </p>
